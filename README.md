# Volunteer One, Get One

## A real time google-home interface that lets you create or participate in local volunteering events

### Inspiration
People love BOGO! Why not VOGO? Just like Buy One, Get One Free, Volunteer One, and Get Points toward 100 act of good! According to Jeanne Segal, Ph.D. and Lawrence Robinson, volunteering helps counteract the effects of stress, anger, and anxiety. It could also make you happy, provide a sense of purpose, and combats depression. As impactful volunteering is to humans, it isn't too readily accessible. Plus, many volunteer matching websites require you to have a 501(c) non-profit organization in order to recruit volunteers as well. That is why we created VOGO. Host, Volunteer, and share the act of good.

### What it does
Once you activate VO GO, you can choose to be a host of the event or a volunteer looking for an event. As a host, you are able to make an event, which will be stored internally in our firebase server. As a volunteer, you are able to check volunteer opportunities around your desired location at desired date.

### How I built it
We used Google's Dialogflow and Javascript for our front end algorithms, and Firebase for our backend database.The purpose of this google home interface is to help people easily post and participate in volunteer activities, big or small.

### Challenges I ran into
Due to our team members being new to Dialogflow and Google Home series products, we had trouble getting used to the workings of google cloud platform and fetching the data from firebase to Dialogflow.

### Accomplishments that We are proud of
We're proud to have started from very scratch and have finished our desired product within 24-30 hours. We're also proud of our teamwork that helped us efficiently manage our time and work responsibilities.

The VOGO (Volunteer One, Get One) project makes posting and participating in volunteer activities easier. Using google home series products, people can volunteer and gain one act of good for 100, from these volunteer-related activities. Our mission is to encourage people to reach out to the communities for a volunteer big or small.
